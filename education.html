                <p>In primary school, I was a curious and enthusiastic kid, eager to learn and explore the world around me. I remember the excitement of stepping into the classroom each morning, ready to embark on new adventures of knowledge.
              I had a genuine thirst for knowledge and loved engaging in class discussions, asking questions, and participating in various activities. Whether it was solving math problems, delving into fascinating science experiments, or unraveling the mysteries of history, I approached each subject with a sense of wonder and eagerness.My favourite subjects were Sports and Math ,i was so good at both of them. In sports, I thrived on the thrill of competition and the joy of physical activity. Whether it was running, jumping, or playing team games, I excelled in various sports and always gave my best effort.
              Outside the classroom, recess was always a thrilling time. I would join my friends in energetic games of tag, racing across the playground with laughter and joy, it was the best.
